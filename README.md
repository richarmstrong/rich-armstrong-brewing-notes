My recipes and approaches from home-brewing 500 gallons of beer

If you can work within four constraints, you can have excellent beer that you made, with minimal hassle.

These are:
1. No chill
2. No sparge
3. No rack
4. No bottles


Chilling requires a chiller, water flow, etc.

Brewers do it for these reasons:
1. It gets the wort out of the kettle, which allows the kettle to be used again immediately. 
2. It minimizes the formation of dimethyl sulfide. This is a "canned corn" aroma. If you want to know what it tastes like in beer, buy a Rolling Rock. They actually chill slower to get a DMS flavor into their beer. DMS happens when its precursors hang around in a hot liquid together for many hours. You can drive off most of these precursors by increasing your boil length to 90 minutes.
3. Most importantly, they have no other choice. There's just no place to put 1000 gallons of boiling hot wort in a brewery. You have a choice
4. It allows them to capture hop flavor and aroma and lock it in. Hop volatiles evaporate at various points along the thermometer.


Sparge refers to the rinsing of the grain bed with hot water to get all the sugars. Backing up, the grain bed is part of all-grain brewing. If you are a purist who wants to avoid all extracts, then go figure out how to do that. The parts before the boil are the mash and the sparge.

Highly recommend brew-in-a-bag. 5 gallon kettle for 3 gallon batches.

1. No hop-forward beers. Of course, all your beers will have hops, but there's an army of poorly paid but passionate brewers dedicated to getting big hop flavor and aroma into beer, and then keeping it there until you drink it. The big thing this will save you is chilling. Chilling is equipment-intensive, and it requires
